#### Live Demo : [Tickets Tracker](https://advanced-ticketing-system.netlify.app/auth)
Ticketing/Issue tracking system allows organizations to organizations or different departments within an organization 
to keep track of what needs to get done, who is working on which tasks,
what's already been done, and when tasks were (or weren't) completed. It uses severity levels for tickets in order to prioritize tasks.
