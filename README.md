### Intro
Ticketing/Issue tracking system allows organizations to organizations or different departments within an organization 
to keep track of what needs to get done, who is working on which tasks,
what's already been done, and when tasks were (or weren't) completed. It uses severity levels for tickets in order to prioritize tasks

The purpose of a ticketing/issue tracking system is to provide a centralized place for tracking and organizing tasks, as well as for communicating about and updating the status of these tasks. It allows organizations to keep track of what needs to be done, who is working on which tasks, and when tasks are completed or overdue. It also helps to ensure that tasks are being completed in a timely and efficient manner, and that no tasks are falling through the cracks.

One of the key features of a ticketing/issue tracking system is the use of severity levels for tickets. This allows organizations to prioritize tasks based on their importance or urgency. Tickets with higher severity levels are given priority over those with lower severity levels, ensuring that the most important tasks are completed first.

Overall, a ticketing/issue tracking system is an invaluable tool for organizations of all sizes and industries. It helps to improve task and project management, increase efficiency, and ensure that important tasks are not overlooked.
